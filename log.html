                <p>Markdown is a very simple method of defining rudamentary formatting. It is useful for environments where
                    the editing is done in plaintext such as a forum post.</p>
                <p>Headers are defined with a preceding hash (#), the amount of hashes determing the header type (1-6). H1 and
                    H2 can also be defined by "underlining" the text with equals (=) or dash (-) respectively.</p>

                <p>Ordered lists are created with lines starting with a number, full stop and a space (0. ). The numbers are
                    often independent of the number at the beginning of the line. Spaces can be added before the number to
                    create sub lists. Unordered lists simply use an asterisk, a minus or a plus and a space (* )</p>

                <h3 id="a_flexbox">Flexbox</h3>
                <p>The Flexible Box Module, or “Flexbox” is a responsive layout model introduced in CSS3. It is a powerful tool
                    that offers space distribution and alignment between elements. I have found it very useful in the development
                    of my site, having never really used it before. It makes some seemingly basic tasks actually simple to
                    achieve where it would have been difficult with the previous layout modes of block, inline table and
                    positioned. For example, centering a dynamic element vertically was a notoriously difficult task to achieve
                    with only elegant css without using properties such as transform which had very little compatibility.</p>
                <p>It can be used on individual elements (e.g. the vertical alignment) or on entire pages to align content dynamically
                    with page size to avoid excessive use of media queries.</p>
                <p>I found the
                    <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">CSS Tricks Complete Guide to Flexbox</a>
                    a very useful page to refer to when learning how to use it.</p>

                <h3 id="a_parallax">Parallax Effect</h3>
                <p>I decided I wanted to experiment with 3D transform to create a parallax effect on my site, taking inspiration
                    from the FireWatch website.
                    <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/performant-parallaxing">Google provided a nice little article</a>
                    explaining how to correctly scale the images so that even though they are “further away” in the z-axis, they appear the same
                    size creating a fake parallax effect. Unfortunately I was unable to get my parallax effect working properly
                    without using a scroll event to actually move it, this is due to me wanting it positioned in the top
                    left rather than taking up the entire width of the page.</p>
                <p>Given more time I would like to improve this so that it is 100% CSS based, as of right now the effect takes
                    advantage of hardware acceleration as all the movement calculations are done with CSS transformations.
                    As mentioned in the Google article, the scroll event is provided as a “best attempt” which means that
                    on lower powered devices (especially noticeable on mobile) the parallax effect stutters. Once the effect
                    was implemented I realised that it was barely noticable on desktop computers as the small window it was
                    displaying in had scrolled out of view so quickly that it is hard to distinguish the individual movement
                    of the layers. On mobile where most of the top half of the screen is covered by the header image it is
                    much easier to see.
